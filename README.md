Welcome to this repository — a comprehensive collection of **151 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems**, personally **curated and classified** by **Piyush Ghoshi**. This list serves as a well-organized roadmap for mastering DSA through consistent practice, especially for those targeting technical interviews, coding competitions, or strengthening core programming skills.

## 📂 What’s Inside?

This project categorizes problems into major topics such as:

- **Arrays & Two Pointers**  
- **Recursion & Backtracking**  
- **Bit Manipulation & Hash Maps**  
- **Heaps, Stacks & Queues**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Trees & Tries**  
- **Binary Search**  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
- **Graphs & Advanced Algorithms**

Each problem is clearly labeled as **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard**, based on standard online judge platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks. This makes it easy for learners to prioritize their practice based on comfort level and difficulty.

## 🎯 Why Use This?

- 🧭 **Structured Learning Path**: Focus your learning by solving problems topic-wise.  
- 📈 **Difficulty Classification**: Filter and practice problems based on your skill level.  
- 🧠 **Interview Readiness**: Topics and patterns included here are frequently asked in interviews by top tech companies.  
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Maintain your own log or sheet based on this classification.

Whether you're just starting with DSA or preparing for coding interviews at top tech companies, this resource gives you a strong foundation and a targeted approach to problem-solving.
